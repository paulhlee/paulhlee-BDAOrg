# About Me
**Name:** Hao Lee
**Major:** Master in Business Administration

## Why Data Analytics?
As a future corporate finance professional, I am expected to discover and communicate insights from a company's financial and operational data. Having the complex statistical skills and the ability to utilize powerful tools like Python and R would be critical. 
I have interest in Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Gathering, Data Wrangling, and Machine Learning. Recently, I have completed Udacity's Data Analyst course and discovered Naive Bayes through the Nanodegree's Introduction to Machine Learning Course.
